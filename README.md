## About PosKu

POS (Point of Sale) is a system used in business to manage product or service sales transactions to customers. POS can be software or hardware that works in an integrated manner to manage various aspects of transactions, including price calculations, calculating the number of products sold, payment processing, and storing transaction information.

1. Recording Transactions: POS allows shopkeepers or employees to record and manage sales transactions quickly and efficiently. This includes inputting items purchased, quantity, price, discount, and total payment.
2. Price Calculation: POS calculates the total price of the customer's purchases based on the selected item and the set price. This minimizes calculation errors and ensures that the customer pays the correct amount.
3. Stock Management: POS can be connected to a stock management system to automatically reduce stock amounts after sales transactions. This helps business owners to always know product availability and prevent unexpected stock outs.
4. Payment Processing: POS allows processing various types of payments, such as cash, credit cards, debit cards, or other digital payment methods. This makes it easier for customers to make payments according to their preferences.
5. Issuance of Receipts or Invoices: POS generates receipts or invoices as proof of purchase for customers. This is important for your purchase track record and as proof of warranty or return of goods.
